                <p>Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special relativity). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another (principle of relativity).</li>
                    <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the source of the light.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics, e.g. in the Michelson–Morley experiment that supports postulate 2, but also has many surprising consequences. Some of these are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.</li>
                    <li>Time dilation: Moving clocks are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.</li>
                    <li>Length contraction: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.</li>
                    <li>Mass–energy equivalence: E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.</li>
                    <li>Maximum speed is finite: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of classical mechanics by the Lorentz transformations. (See Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism).</p>
